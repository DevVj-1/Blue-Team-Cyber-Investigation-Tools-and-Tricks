## Checklist for Handling a Suspicious Phishing Email and Attached Files

### 1. Do Not Interact with the Email
- **Do Not Click**: Avoid clicking any links, downloading attachments, or replying to the email.
- **Do Not Enable**: If the email prompts you to enable macros or content, do not enable them.

### 2. Verify the Sender
- **Check Email Address**: Verify the sender's email address by hovering over it. Look for misspellings or unusual domains.
- **Use Email Verification Tools**: Use tools like [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io) or [EmailRep](https://emailrep.io) to check the legitimacy and reputation of the email address.
- **Inspect Headers**: Analyze the email headers to identify any anomalies in the sender's information.

### 3. Analyze the Email Content
- **Look for Red Flags**: Check for signs of phishing, such as poor grammar, urgent language, or requests for personal information.
- **Compare to Legitimate Emails**: If the email claims to be from a known organization, compare it to previous legitimate emails from that organization.

### 4. Scan the Attached Files
- **Use Online Sandboxes**: Upload the attachment to online sandboxes like [ANY.RUN](https://any.run), [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com), or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to analyze the file's behavior.
- **Scan with Antivirus**: Run the file through your local antivirus software to detect any known malware.

### 5. Investigate Any URLs
- **Check URL Reputation**: Use tools like [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com) or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to check the reputation of any URLs in the email.
- **Inspect URLs Carefully**: Hover over any links to inspect the full URL. Be cautious of shortened URLs or those with unusual domains.

### 6. Report the Email
- **Internal Reporting**: Follow your organization's procedure for reporting phishing emails. This could involve forwarding the email to your IT or security team.
- **External Reporting**: Report the phishing attempt to relevant authorities or services like [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com).

### 7. Quarantine the Email
- **Move to Spam/Junk**: If confirmed as phishing, move the email to your spam or junk folder.
- **Block the Sender**: Block the sender's email address to prevent future phishing attempts from the same source.

### 8. Document the Incident

### 9. Monitor for Impact
